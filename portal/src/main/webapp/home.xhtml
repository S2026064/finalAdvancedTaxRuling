                        <p>
                            An Advance Tax Ruling is a written statement issued by SARS that provides clarity and certainty on the Commissioner’s interpretation and application of the tax laws regarding a proposed transaction. A taxpayer (applicant) can apply for a Binding Private or a Binding Class Ruling.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Binding Private Ruling -->
                        <h4 style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">What is a Binding Private Ruling?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A Binding Private Ruling is a written statement issued by SARS regarding the application of a tax act to one or more parties to a proposed transaction.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Binding Class Ruling -->
                        <h4 style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">What is a Binding Class Ruling?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A Binding Class Ruling is a written statement issued by SARS regarding the application of a tax act to a specific class of persons in respect of a proposed transaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A class would be shareholders, members, beneficiaries (or similar) in respect of a company, association, pension fund or trust; or a group of persons that may be unrelated but are similarly affected by the proposed transaction and agree to be represented by the applicant.
                        </p>

                        <h4 style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold;">Are there any fees payable?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yes, in terms of section 81(1) of the Tax Administration Act the Commissioner may prescribe an application and a cost recovery fee to defray the cost of the ‘advance ruling’ system. There are three payments required during the ruling application process:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
                            <li>Application fee – a non-refundable fee that does not form part of the total cost of the application.</li>
                            <li>Deposit (advance payment) on the cost recovery fee – calculated at 20% of the higher range of the estimated fee range.</li>
                            <li>Final payment of the outstanding balance in respect of the cost recovery fee – to settle the invoice for the work performed/time spent in processing the ruling request.</li>
                        </ol>
